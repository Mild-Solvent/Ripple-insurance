## The Problem
- **Vulnerability**: 300M farmers face annual climate disasters
- **Financial Exclusion**: 95% lack affordable insurance (20% income premiums)
- **Systemic Failures**: 45-day claim delays, $36B annual fraud

## Our Solution
### Hybrid Blockchain Architecture
- **XRPL Ledger**: 3-second settlement for RLUSD payouts
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Trustless policy management
- **Chainlink Oracles**: Real-time NASA/MODIS weather data integration
